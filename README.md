This software implements a proxmox backup client software for windows, backup only as of now
Works on linux too especially for development

The software is still alpha quality and i take no responsability for any kind of damage or data loss even of source files.

Contributions are welcome especially 

1. GUI with tray icon to show backup progress and backup taking place
2. Encryption support
3. A GUI way of configuring it and maybe create a json job file similiar freefilesync does
4. Async upload / compress and multicore upload + compression of chunks
5. Proxmox side patch to add another kind of entry to pxar format with Windows security descriptors in it
6. Support for windows symlinks
7. Anything interesting you can come up with :)

Usage
=====

A typical command would look like:
```shell
proxmoxbackupgo.exe -baseurl "https://yourpbshost:8007" -certfingerprint pbsfingerprint -authid "user@realm!apiid" -secret "apisecret" -backupdir "C:\path\to\backup" -datastore "datastorename"

Note on mail templating:
[Go's templating engine](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) is used for mail subjects and bodies, please refer to the documentation for the syntax.
The following variables are available for templating:
- `.NewChunks`: number of new chunks created
- `.ReusedChunks`: number of chunks reused
- `.Datastore`: datastore name
- `.Error`: error message if any
- `.Hostname`: hostname of the machine
- `.StartTime`: time the backup started
- `.EndTime`: time the backup ended
- `.Duration`: duration of the backup
- `.FromattedDuration`: formatted duration of the backup
- `.Success`: a boolean telling whether the backup was successful 
- `.Status`: string representation of the backup status [SUCCESS, FAILURE]

Stream Backup
=============
This allows backing up a stream instead of a PXAR, allows endless possibilities for example you can invoke 

```
mysqldump yourdatabase | ./proxmoxbackupgo -backupstream yourdatabase.sql [other options]
```

This allows leveraging buzhash for dedup even when using tar for example, or the sql dump itself, and if someone wants to attempt it should be possible with some hack to pipe DISM command to generate WIM image to this and have full host backup

Known Issues
============

Windows defender antimalware being active will slow backup down up to 25% of attainable speed
